# 🧠 The Cortex Protocol
## A Founder's System for Compounding Insight with AI

> "Your best ideas don't come from one prompt. They come from layers, links, and time."

This is how I organize my thinking in Cursor to:
- **Reuse hard-won lessons** across projects
- **Cross-reference ideas** with Obsidian-style linking
- **Generate content faster** with AI-augmented templates
- **Build a personal knowledge moat** that compounds

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

├── notes/ ..................... # Date-stamped insights (folder only)
└── .gitignore ................. # Ignore logs, cache, etc. (minimal)
```

## 📝 Note Template

Every insight gets captured using our standardized template:

```markdown
# [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Context:** What triggered this insight?  
**Key Takeaway:** One sentence summary

## 🔗 How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** to your local machine
2. **Open in Cursor** for AI-powered editing
3. **Use the template** for every new insight
4. **Link everything** with `[[page-name]]` syntax
5. **Commit regularly** to build your knowledge base

## 💡 Why This Works (vs. Chat-based AI)

| Chat AI | Cortex Protocol |
|---------|-----------------|
| Ephemeral conversations | Permanent knowledge base |
| No context between sessions | Rich cross-references |
| Scattered across platforms | Centralized, searchable |
| Hard to build on past work | Compounding insights |
